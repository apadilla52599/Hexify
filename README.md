A Spotify Premium account is necessary to be able to access Hexify. 

Hexify uses Spotify Web API to recommend similar artists when an artist is selected.

To start out, drag an artist from the right side onto the canvas.
Recommendations will appear in the hexagonal tiles that are adjacent to the selected artist. You can add a recommended artist by clicking on their image.

## Running Hexify Locally


### Step 1: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### Step 2: `node server.js`

Starts the app on localhost:8080

### Step 3: go to `localhost:8080` on your web browser

Now you can create a beautiful work of art and a playlist that matches it!
